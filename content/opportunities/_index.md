title: Research opportunities

  If you are interested in joining my research group, or for any other enquiries, please contact me. You can find my most up-to-date contact details on my [University of Queensland page](https://about.uq.edu.au/experts/15140). I am recruiting Honours, Masters, and PhD students. I am also interested in supporting Postdoctoral Research Fellows, and I have several exciting research projects available that align with my interests in Ecological Forecasting, One Health, and Community Ecology. This  page hosts some of the more specific projects that are available, but please see my [Talks & Workshops page](https://ecogambler.netlify.app/talk/) and my [Blog](https://ecogambler.netlify.app/blog/) for other examples of research directions that I am interested in pursuing.

** No content below YAML for the talk _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside talk/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
