title: "2025 R Workshops @ UQ"
excerpt: "I have recently joined the R Workshops @ UQ team, which has been conducting several R Workshops at the University of Queensland each year since 2012. The team is composed of a wonderful group of quantitative ecologists who have learnt data analysis and data science through application to real-world problems in R. Because we are self-taught, we want to help others avoid some of the mistakes we made when we were setting out to learn and use R. We have now taught >1,500 students at these workshops, and we look forward to helping the next generation of R programmers and applied statisticians learn the skills they need to meet the demands of the modern research environment. The 2025 workshops, happening over 5 days in February, will cover the `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, linear models, Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive Models, spatial and spatiotemporal modelling, multivariate modelling and much more!"
