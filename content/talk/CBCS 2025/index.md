title: "Why you should embrace ecological forecasting"
excerpt: "Ecological forecasting offers a powerful shift in how we approach research - moving from static, retrospective analyses to dynamic, iterative workflows that evolve with new data. This presentation challenges ecologists to rethink how they structure their projects by highlighting how forecasting forces us to confront uncertainty, clarify assumptions, and make our understanding of ecological systems explicit. By continuously testing predictions against observations, forecasting reveals both the strengths and limits of our models, encouraging more transparent and adaptive science. Two applied examples will illustrate how these ideas can be put into practice, offering inspiration for ecologists seeking to build more responsive and insightful research programmes."
