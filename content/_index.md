description: "This site hosts some of my thoughts on data science and statistical modeling for ecology, along with information about my research and other miscellanies. Have a look through the site to find out what I'm up to and to peruse a collection of posts on (somewhat) interesting and (hopefully) useful tips for ecological modeling, with (perhaps too much) emphasis on Generalized Additive Models. For more details on my research, please see [my university researcher profile](https://about.uq.edu.au/experts/15140)."
