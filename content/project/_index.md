description: "I develop and maintain a number of R packages for analysing and interrogating ecological data. When using any software (including my own) please make sure to appropriately acknowledge the hard work that developers and maintainers put into making these packages available. Citations are currently the best way to formally acknowledge this work, so we highly encourage you to cite any packages that you rely on for your research."
