      <p class="lh-copy mb4">Emergency department data tells compelling stories about healthcare access and system pressure, but static visualizations often fail to capture the full complexity of spatiotemporal patterns. I demonstrate how to build an interactive Shiny dashboard step-by-step, starting with simple static plots and progressively adding features like reactive filtering, interactive maps, and population-adjusted trend analysis. Using NSW and ACT hospital emergency admissions data, we&rsquo;ll create a dashboard that allows real-time exploration of triage categories, hospital networks, and temporal trends while implementing performance optimizations and deployment strategies.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy mb4">Compositional data appears everywhere in scientific research, yet many analysts fall back on problematic approaches that ignore fundamental mathematical constraints. I demonstrate how Dirichlet regression with Gaussian process smooths provides a principled framework for modeling plant community composition across environmental gradients, using approximate Hilbert space methods that make these models computationally tractable for realistic datasets. Unlike separate binomial models that can predict impossible total abundances exceeding 100%, this approach automatically ensures predictions respect compositional constraints while capturing complex nonlinear environmental responses.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy mb4">Customer Lifetime Value models are critical for SaaS businesses, but standard regression approaches often predict impossible values like negative revenue or infinite growth. There are established methods to handle this (i.e. constrained optimization, truncation), but these can be complex to implement and maintain in production. Even fewer approaches naturally incorporate business logic while remaining interpretable and deployable. This post demonstrates how to build CLV models that automatically respect business reality using GAMs, creating predictions that make sense without complex constraint matrices or manual bounds checking.</p>

    </header>
      
      <p class="lh-copy mb4">Time series analysis and forecasting are standard goals in applied ecology. But most time series courses focus only on traditional forecasting models such as ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing. These models cannot handle features that dominate ecological data, including overdispersion, clustering, missingness, discreteness and nonlinear effects. Using the flexible and powerful Bayesian modelling software Stan, we can now meet this complexity head on. R packages such as {<code>mvgam</code>} and {<code>brms</code>} can build Stan code to specify ecologically appropriate models that include nonlinear effects, random effects and dynamic processes, all with simple interfaces that are familiar to most R users. In this course you will learn how to wrangle, visualize and explore ecological time series. You will also learn to use the {<code>mvgam</code>} and {<code>brms</code>} packages to analyse a diversity of ecological time series to gain useful insights and produce accurate forecasts. All course materials (presentations, practical exercises, data files, and commented R scripts) will be provided electronically to participants.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy mb4">I have recently joined the R Workshops @ UQ team, which has been conducting several R Workshops at the University of Queensland each year since 2012. The team is composed of a wonderful group of quantitative ecologists who have learnt data analysis and data science through application to real-world problems in R. Because we are self-taught, we want to help others avoid some of the mistakes we made when we were setting out to learn and use R. We have now taught &gt;1,500 students at these workshops, and we look forward to helping the next generation of R programmers and applied statisticians learn the skills they need to meet the demands of the modern research environment. The 2025 workshops, happening over 5 days in February, will cover the <code>tidyverse</code>, <code>ggplot2</code>, linear models, Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive Models, spatial and spatiotemporal modelling, multivariate modelling and much more!</p>

      <p class="lh-copy mb4">Vector Autoregressions (VAR models), also known as Multivariate Autoregressions (MAR models), offer a way to model delayed and contemporaneous interactions among sets of multiple time series. These models are widely used in econometrics and psychology, among other fields, where they can be analyzed to ask many interesting questions about potential causality or stability. But software to fit these models to real-world time series, which often present as non-Gaussian counts, proportions or even binary observations with measurement error, is lacking. Here I show how to fit VARs in a State-Space format, and how to interrogate the models to ask meaningful questions about interactions and stability, using the mvgam package in R.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy mb4">Many time series show repeated seasonal patterns, and fitting models that can capture this seasonality is a major focus of time series forecasting algorithms. There are a lot of useful, established methods to deal with this (i.e. SARIMA, Harmonic regression), but sometimes the seasonal patterns change over time. Fewer time series and forecasting models can handle this feature. This post introduces some strategies for capturing time-varying seasonality and time-varying periodicity in Dynamic Generalized Additive Models, using the mvgam package in R.</p>

    </header>
      
      <p class="lh-copy mb4">Marine ecosystems are under increasing threat from warming waters. Winter warming is occurring at a faster rate than summer warming for ecosystems around the world, but most studies focus on the summer. Here, we show that winter warming could affect coastal fish community compositions in the Mediterranean Sea using a model that captures how biotic associations change with sea surface temperature to influence species’ distributions for 215 fish species. Species’ associations control how communities are formed, but the effect of winter warming on associations will be on average four times greater than that of summer warming. Projections using future climate scenarios show that 60% of coastal Mediterranean grid cells are expected to lose fish species by 2040. Heavily fished areas in the west will experience diversity losses that exacerbate regime shifts linked to overexploitation. Incorporating seasonal differences will therefore be critical for developing effective coastal fishery and marine ecosystem management. Clark, N.J., Kerry, J.T. &amp; Fraser, C.I. Rapid winter warming could disrupt coastal marine fish community structure. Nature Climate Change 10, 862–867 (2020).
